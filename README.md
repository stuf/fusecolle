Just a simple experiment made "for fun", which involves (somewhat roughly) recreating the Kancolle interface in with [Fuse](https://www.fusetools.com). So let's start with some crude shapes and simple views, including navigation, and see where that takes us from there.

## Requirements

 * Fuse 0.32 or later
 * A modern version of Node.js
 * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

## Developing

First, start by launching the preview

```
fuse preview
```

or

```
yarn start
```

Since we'll be using what'll essentially be the equivalent of the game's viewport in the browser, be sure to ensure that you're using the proper "device" in preview. In this case, while in Fuse Preview, go to *View* → *Kancolle View* to make sure the preview is targeting the correct viewport size.

## Issues, improvements

Post any issues, bugs or improvements to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/stuf/fusecolle/issues) found in this repository.
