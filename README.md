Just a simple experiment made "for fun", which involves (somewhat roughly) recreating the Kancolle interface in with [Fuse](https://www.fusetools.com). So let's start with some crude shapes and simple views, including navigation, and see where that takes us from there.

## Requirements

 * Fuse 0.32 or later
 * A modern version of Node.js
 * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

## Development

First, start by launching the preview

```
fuse preview
```

or

```
yarn start
```

Since we'll be using what'll essentially be the equivalent of the game's viewport in the browser, be sure to ensure that you're using the proper "device" in preview. In this case, while in Fuse Preview, go to *View* → *Kancolle View* to make sure the preview is targeting the correct viewport size.

More information about this is available in the [documentation](docs/index.md).
